This is my first project in which I want to build a login system in Python.

**As for now the application allows to:**
* Login
* Create a new account

**Functionalities to be added in the future:**
* Password should contains: numbers, uppercase/lowercase letters,  special signs
* User should provide e-mail address as a login and app will recognize if that address is in correct format
* Possibility to change the password
* Credentials will be stored in the database instead of .txt file
* Simple GUI

Wish me luck! :)
